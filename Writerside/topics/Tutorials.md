# Tutorials

We provide a series of tutorials that showcase and help the user learn different aspects of libgran. Below is the list
of available tutorials and a summary of what aspect of libgran each tutorial covers.

- [Example simulation](Example-simulation.md) - setting up a simulation using built-in force models, outputting and
  visualizing results

- [Custom binary force model](Custom-binary-force-model.md) - implementing a custom pairwise inter-particle force model
  and using the custom model in a simulation in combination with built-in models

- [Custom unary force model](Custom-unary-force-model.md) - implementing a custom force model that acts on a particle
  independently of other particles and using the custom model in a simulation in combination with built-in models

- [Custom step handler](Custom-step-handler.md) - implementing a custom step handler and using it in a simulation
